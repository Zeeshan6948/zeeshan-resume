    description1: "Hello! I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a strong interest in DevOps and cloud technologies.",
    description2: "I have hands-on experience with PHP, Python (Django), C#, Flutter (Dart), Docker, Kubernetes, and Prometheus. During my Master's in International Software Systems Science, I worked on a Flutter-based mobile application for performing surveys. While the project was academic, the experience of building the app was so exciting that it led me to pursue a career in web and mobile development. I'm always eager to expand my skills, and I recently earned the Microsoft AZ-204 certification in cloud solutions.",
